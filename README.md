# 🖥️ Help Desk Reporting Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Overview
The **Help Desk Reporting Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project designed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to IT service operations.  
It provides a centralized view of ticket management, response times, resolution efficiency, and agent performance — helping organizations make data-driven decisions to improve support quality and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To design a data-driven reporting system that:
- Tracks **help desk ticket lifecycle** (creation, assignment, resolution).
- Measures **SLA compliance** and **agent productivity**.
- Identifies **bottlenecks** and **trends** in customer support.
- Delivers actionable insights using **Power BI visualizations**.

The dataset contains the following key attributes:
| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Ticket_ID | Unique identifier for each ticket |
| Created_Date | Date the ticket was raised |
